You can use the words ALL or ANY where the right side of the operator might have multiple values. 
SELECT name FROM world
 WHERE population > ALL
      (SELECT population FROM world
        WHERE continent='Europe')

Find the largest country (by area) in each continent, show the continent, the name and the area: 

The above example is known as a correlated or synchronized sub-query.
Using correlated subqueries

A correlated subquery works like a nested loop: the subquery only has access to rows related to a single record at a time in the outer query. The technique relies on table aliases to identify two different uses of the same table, one in the outer query and the other in the subquery.

One way to interpret the line in the WHERE clause that references the two table is “… where the correlated values are the same”.

In the example provided, you would say “select the country details from world where the population is greater than or equal to the population of all countries where the continent is the same”.
